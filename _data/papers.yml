- title: Elastica Energy Regularization via Graph Cuts 
  webpage: /graph-flow/
  desc: > 
    We propose a graph cut model to optimize bidimensional shapes with respect
    to the elastica energy and we show how our iterative and dicrete process relates with the 
    curve-shortening flow. Our model can be included in an image segmentation pipeline and we 
    provide a study to evaluate its effects on the segmentation task.

- title: Geometric Constraints and Variational Approaches to Image Analysis (PhD Thesis) 
  webpage: https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03560490/
  desc: >
      The thesis investigate image analysis methods based on geometric priors, mainly
      curvature. The thesis presents an overview of continuous and discrete methods 
      and introduce four new models where we explore the use of multigrid convergent
      estimators to estimate the geometric quantities that are used as priors.

- title: "Combinatorics of Local Search: An Optimal 4-Local Hall's Theorem for Planar Graphs" 
  webpage: /local-search/
  desc: >
      We prove a tight bound for a local Hall's theorem for planar graphs. This 
      bound is appliable to the complexity analysis of several combinatorial 
      problems based on local search.
