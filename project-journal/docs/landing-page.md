# Landing Page

The Landing Page project has the role of link aggregator. It contains general
information about the other sub-projects of the personal web-page.

## Base Jekyll Project

The landing page uses the [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline)
developed by [Thomas Zuhlke](https://github.com/tzuehlke).

## Fontawesome

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a collection of icons that are easily coupled
with css. In order to use, one could opt to create a custom kit or to host the
fontawesome yourself. 

- Custom Kit: You select the icons you wish to user and they will be available in 
the cloud. No need to host anything at your own. The only problem is that you need
to enable CORS (Cross Origin Resourse Sharing) on your server.
- Host yourself: You download the fontawesome files and follow the instructions
described [here](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/host-yourself/webfonts).
